  # Metric based on 'users' semantic model
  - name: sum_total_lifetime_revenue
    label: "Sum of Total Lifetime Revenue"
    description: "The sum of the lifetime_revenue column across all users."
    type: sum # Maps to Eppo 'simple' type, op 'sum'
    measure:
      name: total_lifetime_revenue # References measure in 'users' SM
    # Example meta tags for Eppo metric properties

  # Metric based on 'users' semantic model with a filter
  - name: count_active_users_ca
    label: "Active Users (Canada)"
    description: "The count of active users whose country code is 'CA'."
    type: sum # Summing the 0/1 active flag measure

  # You could add a simple count metric for orders if needed:
  # - name: count_orders
  #   label: "Total Order Count"
  #   description: "The total count of distinct orders."
  #   type: count_distinct # Maps to Eppo 'simple' type, op 'count_distinct' or 'distinct_entity'
